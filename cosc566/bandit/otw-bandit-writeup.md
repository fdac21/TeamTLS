# OverTheWire Bandit Project

## Student Information

* Student name: **Benjamin Greenberg**
* NetId: **bgreenb3**


## Project Description

In this project, you will be complete the Bandit challenges at <https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/>. For each challenge, you will complete the following worksheet describing:
1. The credentials found in the challenge.
2. How you solved the challenge. Include the commands and scripts you used to retrieve the credentials. You can use the linux command `history` to view commands used in the current session.
3. What sins (as found in the *24 Deadly Sins* book) are evidenced in the challenge.
4. How those sins should be addressed to address your exploit.

In the workshop, the challenges are named based on the username used to login to the shell for that challenge. For example, the challenge labeled "Natas 10" will be logged into with the username natas10, and the solution will be the credentials for the user natas11.

You can find a basic guide for markdown formatting [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). In particular, note the [code section](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code) which should be used to annotate any code or commands used in your writeup.

## Hints
There are hints for each challenge on the [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) webpage.

Below are several additional hints:
* Bandit 24: The netcat server dies if sent too much input. Limit how much content you send per connection.
* Bandit 25: This level is only finished once you have the password for bandit26. The ssh key along is insufficient. Also, how does `vi` factor into all of this?
* Bandit 28â€“30: Core `git` features include commits, branches, and tags.
* Bandit 32: `sh` has access to argc and argv.
